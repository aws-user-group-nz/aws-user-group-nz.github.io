AWS User Group Aotearoa is a user/community run, vendor neutral community. The group is dedicated to being open, welcoming, thought-provoking, and free of anyone trying to sell something or recruit members. The group is an open community to learn and share knowledge – attendees are encouraged to share thoughts, questions, and experiences in loosely structured discussions.  However, we are focused on Amazon Web Services (AWS) related content, but that gives scope for a broad range of topics and view points.<br />
<br />
Because of our interactive and open environment, we will not tolerate harassment in any form, will not share attendee personal data, and will not distribute or sell attendee information to anyone.<br />
<br />
By attending an AWS User Group Aotearoa Meetup, User Group or Community Day, you agree to comply with the group’s code of conduct (this page), and will comply with all applicable laws, including additional event and venue rules and regulations (including instructions from staff).<br />
<br />
<h2>Anti-harassment Policy:</h2>
AWS User Group Aotearoa is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate the harassment of participants in any form. Meetup and Community Day participants violating these rules may be asked to leave or blocked from future events at the discretion of the organizers.<br />
Harassment includes verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.<br />
If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an organizer immediately for help.<br />
<br />

<h2>Inclusion Policy:</h2><br />
AWS User Group Aotearoa is a straightforward after work meetup group, and sponsors only cover the costs of hosting, drinks and pizzas (and usually the organizers have to pitch in). While we do not have standard arrangements for those who are hearing impaired, visually impaired, gender-neutral, or disabled, we can however make arrangements to accommodate and include all. If you have any concerns or special considerations, please contact the organizers before the next event.<br />
<br />
<h2>Recording/Social Media Policy:</h2><br />
AWS User Group Aotearoa is a place to share information, not only with other participants but also with those who may not be able to attend. Sessions are, by default, considered open and can be written about on social media and photographed. Please assume all speakers and participants are sharing their own thoughts and opinions, not those of their employers. If you do not want your picture taken, your words to be recorded or for either photographs or words to be attributed to you, please let other attendees know. As a courtesy, please always ask prior to creating sound or video recordings of any event. Please be thoughtful and respectful with your photographs, recording, and sharing.<br />
Each event can decide to adopt different rules at the beginning of the session (e.g., completely private, or no attribution without asking first) as long as all attendees are informed.<br />
<br />
We expect participants to follow these rules at all meetup/community day venues and related social events. Be excellent to each other.<br />
